# üíñ KAWAII PHOTO BOOTH / VINTAGE PHOTO EDITOR üéÄ

A fully frontend-based, retro-themed photo editing web application inspired by the charm of early 2000s aesthetics. This project combines the visual style of vintage photo booths with modern browser capabilities like webcam access and real-time image manipulation. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and served locally using Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server.

## üåü PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Kawaii Photo Booth is a playful, interactive editor that allows users to:
- Upload an image or use their live camera
- Apply cute and quirky filters such as `Y2K`, `Neon`, `Pixel`, `Vapor`, and more
- Customize their image with a colorful and nostalgic interface
- Create content perfect for memes, zines, scrapbooks, or personal expression

The goal was to emulate the look and feel of vintage web design, such as Windows 95 programs or MySpace sticker editors, but with modern JavaScript-powered features.
